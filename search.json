I would love to come in to school more but can’t after school is out.\n\n\nActivities are often too late in the evening for kindergarten to attend.\n\n\nNo you guys are great thank you for all you do!\n\n\nWonderful programs"

    "text": "Comments left by survey responders\n\nHomework support & inclusive holiday support would be cool\n\n\nI love the family nights that have engaging activities. The STEM night was my favorite. I would love an Art night, a sensory-friendly night, an inclusive holiday event night, exercise night (maybe a class like yoga or Zumba - maybe there’s a parent who could teach a class for free?), a baking or cooking class night. I think a toy or book swap would be really fun. Bike to school day would be great! https://www.walkbiketoschool.org/. I think a family picnic day would be fun. I like the idea of the movie night but I think it’s too often geared towards the older kids. I like the 1.5 hr events that start at 5:30 on a Friday evening. And having concessions available is very nice. I wonder if we could also have a donation bin (for money) or QR code donation option available too to help sponsor these events\n\n\nCultural night - all kids can learn from different cultures and food !\n\n\nWe love the family get togethers on a Friday night. We like seeing all the kids and playing together\n\n\nField trip for 5th and 4th grades\n\n\nSensory friendly game nights\n\n\na winter festival and more events!\n\n\nLearning independence\n\n\nSensory-friendly family nights\n\n\nResource fair, family picnic day, inclusive holiday events\n\n\nLevel Up after school clubs, Parents’ Night Out, Karaoke night fundraiser, car wash, pancake breakfast, silent auction, pie-in-the-face fundraiser, PTA cookoff, Father Daughter / Mother Son dance, Bingo Night, Trunk-or-Treat Party, Ice Cream Social, art night, …\n\n\nCareer day, beach/park clean up, karaoke night, car wash, parents night off,"

    "text": "Conclusions\nThere is definitely enthusiasm for Fall Festival, STEM nights, and Holiday gift shop. There are some good ideas for new events left by responders that we should consider. Timing of PTA events seems like a big barrier to participation and we can try and think creativly about how accommdate different schedules. Having more sensory friendly events can help engage SpED famlies in PTA events. Finally, based on the data, there is more enthusiasm for electronic means of communication (Class Dojo, email, text) for PTA events.\nThere were 30 survey responses, with two-thirds from Kinder and UTK families. While this may skew results toward lower grade perspectives, addressing their suggestions could foster stronger long-term engagement with the PTA."
