## Comments left by survey reponsders for question 1:

> Timing for many events is around dinner and bed-time (especially for younger kids)

> Would like to see more STEM nights as they are more interactive for the kids.

> Please do more during the school day. I would love to come in to school more but can’t after school is out.

> Activities are often too late in the evening for kindergarten to attend.

> No you guys are great thank you for all you do!

> Wonderful programs




## Question 1 summary

Fall Festival, STEM night, and Holiday Show all exhibited a strong level of interest. 
Glow dance party and Movie nights were also well recieved. Swap meet didn't exhibit the same 
level of enthusiasm as the other events. Parents would like to see events to be earlier in the evening or during the day. 



# Question 2

>Do you have any suggestions for additional activities, programs, workshops  you would like to see the PTA put on in 2025-26?


## Comments left by survey responders

> Homework support & inclusive holiday support would be cool

> I love the family nights that have engaging activities. The STEM night was my favorite. I would love an Art night, a sensory-friendly night, an inclusive holiday event night, exercise night (maybe a class like yoga or Zumba - maybe there's a parent who could teach a class for free?), a baking or cooking class night. I think a toy or book swap would be really fun. Bike to school day would be great! https://www.walkbiketoschool.org/. I think a family picnic day would be fun. I like the idea of the movie night but I think it's too often geared towards the older kids. I like the 1.5 hr events that start at 5:30 on a Friday evening. And having concessions available is very nice. I wonder if we could also have a donation bin (for money) or QR code donation option available too to help sponsor these events

> Cultural night - all kids can learn from different cultures and food !

> We love the family get togethers on a Friday night. We like seeing all the kids and playing together

> Field trip for 5th and 4th grades

> Sensory friendly game nights

> a winter festival and more events!

>  Learning independence

> Sensory-friendly family nights

> Resource fair, family picnic day, inclusive holiday events

> Level Up after school clubs, Parents’ Night Out, Karaoke night fundraiser, car wash, pancake breakfast, silent auction, pie-in-the-face fundraiser, PTA cookoff, Father Daughter / Mother Son dance, Bingo Night, Trunk-or-Treat Party, Ice Cream Social, art night, ...

> Career day, beach/park clean up, karaoke night, car wash, parents night off,



# Question 3

>  What barriers, if any, have made it difficult for your family to participate in school or PTA events?


```{python}
#| label: question-3
#| fig-cap: "Question 3 results"

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Original data
pta_participation_barriers = {
    'Time of events': 13,
    'Lack of childcare': 5,
    'Transportation': 0,
    'Communication methods': 0,
    'Language': 0,
    'Accessibility needs': 0,
    'Not feeling included': 0,
}

# Custom colors
colors = {
    'Time of events': 'blue',
    'Lack of childcare': 'red',
    'Transportation': 'orange',
    'Communication methods': 'green',
    'Language': 'purple',
    'Accessibility needs': 'turquoise',

}

# Convert counts to percentages

# Plotting

    ax.bar("PTA Participation Barriers", pct, bottom=bottom, label=barrier, color=colors[barrier])
    bottom += pct

# Formatting

ax.set_title("Barriers to PTA Participation (Percentage)")
ax.set_ylim(0, 100)
#add y-ticks every 10
ax.set_yticks(range(0, 101, 5))
ax.legend(title="Barrier", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## Question 3 Summary

The results suggest that time of events is a big barrier for PTA participation. 

# Question 4

> Are there any types of events or resources you would like to see that specifically support families of students with IEPs or 504 plans?

## Comments left by survey responders

> Organized free play (limited supervision)

> Sensory friendly activities, supplies, resources



# Question 5

> What is the best way for the PTA to communicate with you? (Check all that apply)

```{python}

#| label: Question 5
#| fig-cap: Question 5 results

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
pta_communication_methods = {
    'Email': 25,
    'Text': 19,
    'Phone call': 3,
    'Paper flyers': 11,
    'Class Dojo App': 23,
    'Translated materials': 1,
}

# Sort data by count descending
sorted_items = sorted(pta_communication_methods.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
labels, values = zip(*sorted_items)

# Calculate percentages
total = 29 # people can clicke more than one option
percentages = [(v / total) * 100 if total > 0 else 0 for v in values]
print (f"Total: {total}")
# Plotting
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
bars = ax.bar(labels, values, color='purple')

# Add value and percentage labels on top
for bar, value, pct in zip(bars, values, percentages):
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2, bar.get_height() + 0.5,
            f'{value} ({pct:.1f}%)',
            ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=10)

# Formatting
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Responses")
ax.set_title("Preferred PTA Communication Methods")
plt.xticks(rotation=30, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Question 5 summary

Based on the results, there seems to be a strong peference for electronic means of communication of PTA events. 
Translation of content in different languages has not been something I've seen done in the past, but something
we should consider, espeically given the diverse student body at the school. 

# Question 6

>Do you feel your voice is heard when it comes to decisions made by the PTA?

```{python}

#| label: Question 6
#| fig-cap:  Question 6 results

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Original data
pta_voice_hear = {
    'Always': 13,
    'Sometimes': 8,
    'Rarely': 1,
    'Never': 1,
    
}

# Custom colors
colors = {
    'Always': 'blue',
    'Sometimes': 'red',
    'Rarely': 'orange',
    'Never': 'green',
    
}

# Convert counts to percentages
total = sum(pta_voice_hear.values())
percentages = {k: (v / total) * 100 if total > 0 else 0 for k, v in pta_voice_hear.items()}
#print (percentages)
# Plotting
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))

bottom = 0
for reason, pct in percentages.items():
    #print (f"Reason: {reason}, Percentage: {pct}")
    ax.bar("Is your voice heard", pct, bottom=bottom, label=reason, color=colors[reason])
    bottom += pct

# Formatting
ax.set_ylabel("Percentage (%)")
ax.set_title("Is your voice heard with PTA decisions?")
ax.set_ylim(0, 100)
#add y-ticks every 10
ax.set_yticks(range(0, 101, 5))
ax.legend(title="Reason", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## Question 6 summary

Majority of responses are either always or sometimes. 

## Conclusions

There is definitely enthusiasm for Fall Festival, STEM nights, and Holiday gift shop. There are some good ideas for new events left by responders that we should consider. Timing of PTA events seems like a big barrier to
participation and we can try and think creativly about how accommdate different schedules. Having more sensory friendly events can help engage SpED famlies in PTA events.  Finally, based on the data, it seems like printing PTA fliers may not be the best mode of communication. 

There were 30 survey responses, with two-thirds from Kinder and UTK families. While this may skew results toward lower grade perspectives, addressing their suggestions could foster stronger long-term engagement with the PTA.
